title: On implementing structure in startups
---


#Business fundamentals

I really enjoy working in startups; the excitement, energy and passion really make the work a lot of fun. But startups have their challenges, and I think the biggest challenge is putting in place the structure that is needed to grow and be successful, the same structure that big companies have that guarantees a consistent level of quality output each day.

#A fundamental contradiction

The type of people that like working at startups are typically not the type of people that enjoy working at big companies; the personalities and lifestyles are very different and generally incompatible. Startup people enjoy taking on big risks, and have no trouble breaking the rules or working in a world where no rules exist. These personalities are crucial to a startup's early growth, but at some point they start to hold the company back, because they can't accept the rules that they themselves have created.

So there's a "rules gap" that has to be filled as a startup tries to grow into a midsize company, and that's typically done one of two ways. Either there's some M&A action where the startup is acquired, or through a VC's support in bringing the right people to help manage growth. It seems as though the startups that don't take one of these standard routes has a tough road ahead, because its on its own when trying to find the people that have just the right blend of skills and patience to help the company survive its adolescence.

#Solution

I don't have a good answer yet as to how to gently transition from a venture that has 20 talented people to a going concern with 500+ employees without M&A or VC support. While I consider myself one of the "gap" people that enjoys helping companies grow, the ultimate outcome of the growth phase depends on the ability and willingness of the company's principle's to work together and to make good decisions.
