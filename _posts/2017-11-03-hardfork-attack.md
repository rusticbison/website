Some people are confused about Bitcoin. To be clear, there’s only one Bitcoin software client, and that’s located in this repository on Github:

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)

This exact software client defines the rules of the Bitcoin network. This is Bitcoin. *Nothing else is Bitcoin*.  

Some people don’t like Bitcoin’s software rules, or the way it is developed. So they make their own software projects. Here’s an example of a different software project, which is “forked”, or copied, from the genuine, aforementioned Bitcoin software project:

[https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin)

Notice that the name of the project is quite different: it’s called “Litecoin”. This project is copied from the Bitcoin project, but there are a number of modifications that have been made to the software. It’s designed to be a different cryptocurrency, which behaves in different ways from Bitcoin. You can easily and safely trade Litecoin (LTC) for Bitcoin (XBT or BTC) on cryptocurrency exchanges.

For some reason, some people have decided to launch an attack on Bitcoin. Their plan is to trick you into believing that you’re using the genuine Bitcoin cryptocurrency, when you’re actually using a completely different cryptocurrency. Here’s the counterfeit Bitcoin project, where the attack will come from:

How would the attackers succeed? Their success depends on tricking people who don’t have any real control over their Bitcoin. If you use custodial services, such as Coinbase, Xapo, Bitgo, or Bitpay, you do not control your Bitcoin and you are at serious risk of financial loss. These companies use your money to buy Bitcoin for themselves, and then hope that you never ask for them to deliver it to you. These companies can play a dirty trick on you: they may keep the real Bitcoin that they owe you for themselves, while actually giving you the other, cheaper cryptocurrency. To protect yourself and to keep your funds safe, use one of these technologies instead:


- The [official Bitcoin software](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)
- A hardware wallet such as [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) or [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/)


Your Bitcoin must be carefully secured, and you should never trust anyone else with it. If you currently have an account with a company that took your money and promises to deliver you Bitcoin, you should immediately take possession of your Bitcoin before November 16th, 2017.
