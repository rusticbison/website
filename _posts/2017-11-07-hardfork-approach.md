title: maximizing gains during the hardfork
---




Next week's hardfork attack is a nice opportunity to increase your Bitcoin stack. Here's how to do it safely.

## Be safe.
Make sure your Bitcoin is safe on your Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet. If you do not have one of these devices, don't worry about trying to claim the attacker's coins. It's not worth losing all of your Bitcoin for a relatively small gain.

## Be patient.
Wait for your hardware wallet manufacturer to give you instructions. Both [Trezor](https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-statement-segwit2x-2x-hard-fork-b2x-f245fe4f0fb) and [Ledger](https://www.ledger.fr/2017/11/06/preparing-segwit2x-hard-fork/) will provide you with instructions. If the steps are not clear, stop what you are doing and ask the manufacturer for clarification.

## Be precise.
Follow the instructions you've been given exactly. Take your time as you work through them, triple check your work. Think before you click.

## Be strategic.
Make sure you have a plan for what to do with the coins you're planning to take from the attackers. Which exchange will you send the coins to after you have them? Ensure the exchange you're working with is trustworthy, and that it is not likely to trade against you. Coinbase and GDAX are key backers of the attack on the network, so they are likely to play legal games to keep your money as long as they can, and use your money to trade against you.

Remember that Coinbase/GDAX still has not delivered funds from the previous fork (BCASH) to their customers, so be very careful about doing business with them now.

I think working with a well respected exchange will help you sleep well at night. Have a look at [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/223).

## Be paranoid.
Only send the exchange small amounts. Make your trade, and then immediately withdraw your glorious new Bitcoin to your hardware wallet. Never leave your Bitcoin on the exchange longer than is absolutely necessary to make a trade. Government licensing, regulations and approvals mean nothing; a fully regulated exchange is just as likely to steal your money as one that is operating on the dark web (see Coinbase gleefully taking their users' BCASH).

## Get the most out of your trade.
The people behind the network attack have a lot of money, and they'll try to use it to make the attack successful. We saw this with the BCASH pump, shortly after that coin was released. It might be a good idea to keep a little B2X for a day or two, so you can sell it at a very high price...but I wouldn't wait too long to sell it. The price should become asymptotic, moving towards zero rather quickly.

If you follow this advice then you should be able to increase your Bitcoin holdings by somewhere around 5% to 25%, with almost no risk, for just a few hours of your time.
