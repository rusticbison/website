title: Zcash genesis

I've been watching the Zcash project for some time, and decided to get involved a bit more now that it's been officially released. Zcash is very similar to Bitcoin, but Zcash adds strong privacy features.

# Two concerns

There are two issues I see at the moment with Zcash, which should already be priced in according to the efficient market hypothesis. The first is that it's currently not possible to validate any claims about the amount of coins that are available in the system, what some people refer to as the "inflation" problem. However, I've seen some good ideas floating around that could address this issue later, and inflation alone can't fatally compromise the system's key value proposition of privacy. Plus I think the team's track record is solid and it appears they are interested in the long term success of the system. [The whitepaper](http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf) was released almost three years ago, and a [significant amount of work](https://github.com/zcash/zcash) has gone into the software since then. I think for the developers this is hardly an altcoin pump and dump scheme.

The second big concern is the probability that the system just doesn't do what it's supposed to do, e.g. maintain total privacy. This could be due to a bug in the software or a flaw in the concept. Bugs might be relatively easy to fix, but if the concept is flawed then the Zcash project comes to an end and the value drops to zero. At this point Zcash users would flow back into Bitcoin, which has a broader and more mature network. Bitcoin's lack of privacy is also more socially acceptable, for reasons that won't be addressed at the moment.

# Pricing and growth

Even with these open questions and only being available on the main network for a single day, users have already placed a high valuation on ZEC (1 XBT = 0.4 ZEC). Because it adds strong privacy, ZEC *should* be more valuable than XBT, if the aforementioned concerns don't come into play. I think it's clear that there is strong demand for both a transparent, traceable digital asset like Bitcoin, and a completely private digital asset like Zcash.
