title: Zcash genesis

I've been tracking the Zcash project for some time, and decided to get involved a bit more now that it's been officially released. Zcash is very similar to Bitcoin, but Zcash adds very strong privacy features.

# Two concerns

There are two issues I see at the moment with Zcash, which should already be priced in according to the efficient markets theory. The first is that it's currently not possible to validate any claims about the amount of coins that have been mined, what some people refer to as "inflation". However, I've seen some good ideas floating around that might help address this issue later, and at the moment I don't think it's that big of an issue, in that this would not fatally compromise the system's key value prop of privacy. I also think the team's track record is solid and it appears they are interested in the long term growth of the system. [The whitepaper](http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf) was released almost three years ago, and a [significant amount of work](https://github.com/zcash/zcash) has gone into the software since then. I think for the developers this is hardly an altcoin pump and dump scheme.

The second big concern is the probability that the system just doesn't do what it's supposed to do, e.g. keep transfers private. This could be due to a bug in the software or a flaw in the concept. Bugs might be relatively easy to fix, but if the concept is flawed then the Zcash project comes to an end and the value drops to zero. At this point all Zcash users would flow back into Bitcoin, which is less resource intensive and has a broader and more mature network. Bitcoin's lack of privacy is also more socially acceptable, for reasons that won't be addressed at the moment.

# Pricing and growth

Even with these open questions, investors seem to already be valuing ZEC above XBT, which isn't surprising. Looking at the fundamentals alone, ZEC should be more valuable than XBT. I think it's clear that there is strong demand for both a transparent, traceable digital asset like Bitcoin, and a completely private digital asset like Zcash.
