title: Cryptofinance Presentation for UBS London and UBS Zurich 2016

[This is a slidedeck I created](http://rusticbison.github.io/cryptofinance/#/) with reveal.js. I was surprised at how nicely it renders for mobile, and support for gestures is really nice. This is not only a good way to create modern and professional slides. It is also a great educational tool if you are learning about webapps.
