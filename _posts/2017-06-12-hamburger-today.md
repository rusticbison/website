I’ll gladly pay you fiat (not crypto) currency tomorrow for a hamburger today.

Wimpy, the hamburger-loving Popeye character, knows how to make a deal. And every MBA student is asked a related question when they begin the course of their studies: would you prefer a dollar today, or two dollars a year from now?

A rational actor will behave like Wimpy, and take the asset now. That’s because a hamburger in your stomach is (generally speaking) more valuable than any promise- which can vanish into thin air at any time.

Now let’s assume we have not just one, but two paper currencies in our wallet. These are different in only one way: we know without any doubt that currency USD has a variably increasing and unpredictable supply curve, and currency XBT has a fixed and limited supply curve. We therefore know that USD will be worth less next year, and XBT will be worth more next year. So when we go to the hamburger stand, we will always gladly spend currency USD, until we absolutely run out of USD and have no choice but to (unhappily) spend XBT. If we trust the promise of XBT enough, we might not even spend XBT at all and choose to just go home hungry that day.

As more of the global economy becomes digitized, it becomes easier for people to access stable-supply and trustworthy assets such as Bitcoin and Monero. It will be interesting to see what demand looks like for digital fiat, when it begins to compete with cryptocurrencies that have been around much longer. Governments have tried this in the past (see the Canadian MintChip debacle), but maybe this time it will be different.
