The recent rise in price to just over $1000 USD ($1035 USD this morning) has sparked another debate on how to denominate Bitcoin. Let's examine the arguments and then try to make a decision on how to move forward.

The SI base unit of the money is *Bitcoin*, and one *Bitcoin* is composed of one million Satoshis. Currently, the smallest unit avaiable when we talk about Bitcoin is the Satoshi. We can group and label different quantities of Satoshis:

1,000,000 Satoshi = 1 Bitcoin (BTC)
100,000 Satoshi = 1 millibit (mBTC)
100 Satoshi = 1 bit (microBTC)

1,000 millibit (mBTC) = 1 Bitcoin (BTC)
1,000,000 bits (microBTC) = 1 Bitcoin (BTC)

At most exchanges today, the price is denominated in *Bitcoin*, rather than some other quantity of Satoshis. So why would this change? There's some suspicion that people are hesitant to leave the financial system they loathe for a financial system they don't know. It's hypothesized that there are two reasons why an exchange might start displaying Bitcoin pricing information in different units:

* Psychology. People often say *Bitcoin is over $1000 USD now, I can't afford it.* Companies issuing equity have the same problem when dealing with investors, so they split their stock to make it appear more affordable.
* Increased liquidity. This might help to keep the bid/ask spread on exchanges low.
* Practical Application. Merchants pricing their wares in XBT might find it more sensible to sell one pair of socks, normally $20 USD, for 19.49 mBTC. This seems much easier for consumers to think about than trying to sell one pair of socks for 0.019 BTC.

But there are a few potential downsides:

* Lost brand equity: if we start to talk about *millibits* instead of *Bitcoin*, the public might become confused. Confusion and horror stories due to botched user interfaces and merchant pricing, or from paying incorrect amounts by mistake might lead more people to sit on the sidelines, rather than participate.  
* There doesn't seem to be any evidence that a stock split has any affect on a company's value, so we don't actually know if talking about *millibits* is going to be helpful in promoting the currency anyway.

# Suggestions

This seems to be an issue that won't be resolved anytime soon, as different wallet providers, exchange providers, etc. already use different denominations. Breadwallet uses *bits*, but most of the time I'm using their built-in converter to think in terms of a fiat price anyway.

For merchants that price their goods and services in Bitcoin, it makes sense to start using a measure like mBTC that more closely resembles the fiat prices that consumers are used to.
